# Analysis_COVID19
In this project, we analysis factors that might effect the number of infection cases in different countries.
You can use the dataset in the data folder or download the newest datasets from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases?force_layout=desktop#.
Codes have been tested and can run in Visual Studio Code 2019.
The result of this analysis is "countries with higher GDP per capita" are more prone to have higher "infection cases".
You can visualize other correlations and come up with your own conclusions.
